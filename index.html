        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Project Stay was designed to assist individuals with securing a post secondary education. We have observed the website has misleading information and lacks clear navigation which is causing individuals to not utilize the Project Stay resources. How might we improve the design navigation and content layout so that users can easily determine the onboarding process and follow through with services.</p>

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>This was created by thinking of the path that a user would take when they were on the website. The original website made the user have to go back and forth between the tabs instead of leading the user through all the tabs in the correct order. This affected the design in general to make it easier to navigate the website and make the flow that the user would take more natural and take them in the correct process that they would need in order to get the information in the correct way.</p>

                <p>At first we did user interviews but after talking, we realized that interviews were not the best way to go and we had to completely scrap that and begin our research again by doing usability tests. Learned to make sure to pick the best research method from the beginning so you don't have to backtrack and do double the work</p></li>
            <li class="challengesconclusionsection"><h4>Had to rewrite problem statement</h4>
                Spent a lot of time working on the problem statement. Had to be rewritten a few times due to it not being good enough. This was a challenge because my group and I were already behind and this added more stress to us. Despite this, it made us remain focused so we could finish it and move forward with the rest of the projectt</li>
